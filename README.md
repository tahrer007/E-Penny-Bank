## About the App
Since becoming a cashless person, I miss the experience of saving in a piggy bank.
So the app offers two main unique features:

* Just like a real piggy bank, users can save exact/random small amounts without knowing the total amount until it is opened! 
* Shared boxes; the users can save with their family and friends.
